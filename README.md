 `styles.scss` defines the global styles for the project 
 
 `index.js` is the starting point of the backend

## Running the project

<h3> Starting the backend of the application </h3>

* Navigate to the backend directory (`cd backend`) and run`node index.js` (or `nodemon`). <b>Note you may have to run `npm install` if it's your first time running the app</b>

* In one terminal window run `mongod` to start up mongodb

<h3> Starting the frontend of the application </h3>

 * Run `ng serve` (on another terminal window) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. <b>Note you may have to run `npm install` if it's your first time running the app</b>
 
 
## Code scaffolding 

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.
